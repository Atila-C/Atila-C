- 👋 Hi, I’m @Atila-C
- 👀 I will use this in order to have a go into new projects and ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way through Python/Flask and hopefully will have a few cool stuff to share in the near future.
- 💞️ If you have any Python and/or javascript projects that are related with Crypto/BlockChain or Telecom, I you think that another set of hands could help, drop me a msg.
- 📫 You can reach me by e-mail at atila.canavezi@gmail.com
